            <h2>Ether 12:27</h2>
            <p>27 And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness 
                that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves 
                before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make 
                weak things become strong unto them.</p>

            <p>12 And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, 
                who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the 
                devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when 
                all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you 
                to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye 
                are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall.</p>
